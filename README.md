# Bezy

A next-gen, cross-platform, free & open-source font editor for global scripts.

Built for customization, human-AI collaboration, CLI-heavy professional workflows, education, and user empowerment. This editor is a spiritual successor to the DIY ethos of RoboFont and FontForge, and the customization cultures of Vim, Emacs, Arch Linux, and tool making in traditional Arabic calligrapy.

Bezy is written in the Rust programming language using a game engine to create a performant, fun and aesthetic experience that keeps designers in a flow state. Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, top-notch tooling, and an integrated package manager and build tool. With help from AI tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI, it can be easier to use than Python. Don't be intimidated if you are not an expert programmer—this application is designed for students, designers, and artists to be able to customize it and make their own tools. We believe programming is 21st-century literacy and everyone should do it. There are no high-priest gigabrains discouraging you from touching the source code, this editor is designed from the ground up for user modifications and we belive everyone is capable of learning, understanding, and modifying their tools. For now, the only way to use the application is to compile it from source, this should be seen as an empowering learning opportunity, a design choice for user empowerment and learning.

If you spend a large amount of time with professional software like a font editor, it should be a limitless environment where you can learn and grow, not a prosumer walled garden where you are powerless to make meaningful modifications and understand how the software works. If you create tools that people spend 4-5 hours on daily without any personal growth, you are robbing them of both time and learning opportunities, and time and knowledge are our most valuable assets.

This project is an experiment exploring ways to build better coordination incentives and value capture for independent free & open-source development at the highest quality standards. The world of libre graphics software like Blender, GIMP, and Inkscape has struggled to fully compete with proprietary alternatives, and we want to change that, specifically in education where we believe understanding how your tools work and feeling empowered to modify them is of the utmost importance. We are exploring the Ethereum ecosystem with this goal in mind. The project currently has a Zora creator coin, an ETH treasury, community bug bounties (soon), and plans for subscription-free micropayments on the Ethereum Base L2 for remote AI model access are in the works for 2026.

We aim to be an open and welcoming community that values working in the open and sharing knowledge. Contributors of all skill levels are welcome.
