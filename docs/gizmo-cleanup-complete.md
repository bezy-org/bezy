# Gizmo Cleanup - Complete ‚úÖ

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: COMPLETE - All Gizmos removed from rendering code

---

## Summary

Successfully removed all Gizmo-based rendering from the codebase and converted to mesh-based rendering. The selection system now uses 100% mesh-based rendering, matching the architecture rules in CLAUDE.md.

---

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Delete Dead Code ‚úÖ

**Files Modified**: `src/rendering/selection.rs`, `src/rendering/mod.rs`

**Deleted**:
- `render_selected_entities()` - 93 lines (NEVER REGISTERED)
- `render_all_point_entities()` - 48 lines (NEVER REGISTERED)
- Unused imports: `PointType`, `Selected`, `DragPointState`, `NudgeState`, `SortPointEntity`

**Result**: Removed 148 lines of dead Gizmo code that was never actually running.

### Phase 2: Convert Marquee to Meshes ‚úÖ

**Files Modified**: `src/rendering/selection.rs`

**Replaced**:
- Gizmo-based `render_selection_marquee()` with mesh-based version
- Gizmo-based `draw_dashed_line()` helper with `create_dashed_line_meshes()`

**New Implementation**:
- Uses `MarqueeMesh` component for cleanup tracking
- Creates mesh-based dashed rectangle using `mesh_utils::create_line_mesh()`
- Respects zoom-aware scaling via `camera_scale.adjusted_line_width()`
- Uses Z = 15.0 to render above points
- Follows same pattern as metrics.rs dashed line rendering

**Before**: 250 lines with Gizmos
**After**: 168 lines with meshes
**Reduction**: 82 lines (33% smaller, 100% mesh-based)

## Verification

### ‚úÖ Compilation
```bash
cargo check
# Result: SUCCESS (only unrelated deprecation warnings)
```

### ‚úÖ No Gizmos Remaining
```bash
grep -rn "Gizmos" src/rendering --include="*.rs"
# Result: NO MATCHES
```

### ‚úÖ Architecture Compliance
- All rendering now mesh-based ‚úÖ
- Follows CLAUDE.md line 235 rule ‚úÖ
- Matches existing point rendering pattern ‚úÖ
- Uses theme system colors ‚úÖ
- Zoom-aware scaling ‚úÖ

## How It Works Now

### Selected Points (Already Working)
**File**: `src/rendering/points.rs:101-116`
- Mesh-based rendering with 3-layer system
- Different colors for selected vs unselected
- Already perfect - no changes needed

### Selection Marquee (Now Fixed)
**File**: `src/rendering/selection.rs:21-167`
- Mesh-based dashed rectangle
- Clean up old meshes each frame
- Create 4 edges with dashed line segments
- Each dash is a separate mesh entity
- Uses `MarqueeMesh` component for tracking

### Registration
**File**: `src/editing/selection/mod.rs:134`
```rust
crate::rendering::selection::render_selection_marquee,
```
Same registration, new implementation!

## Testing Checklist

When testing the app:

- [ ] Selection marquee renders during drag selection (click and drag in select mode)
- [ ] Marquee is dashed rectangle (not solid line)
- [ ] Marquee uses theme action color (from theme.json)
- [ ] Selected points render with different colors (mesh-based in points.rs)
- [ ] Marquee respects zoom level (stays visible at all zoom levels)
- [ ] No visual glitches or lag
- [ ] Performance is good (no frame drops)
- [ ] Marquee disappears when drag ends

## File Size Comparison

**Before**:
- `src/rendering/selection.rs`: 250 lines
  - `render_selection_marquee()`: 50 lines (Gizmo)
  - `draw_dashed_line()`: 28 lines (Gizmo)
  - `render_selected_entities()`: 93 lines (Gizmo, DEAD)
  - `render_all_point_entities()`: 48 lines (Gizmo, DEAD)

**After**:
- `src/rendering/selection.rs`: 168 lines (33% smaller)
  - `render_selection_marquee()`: 99 lines (Mesh)
  - `create_dashed_line_meshes()`: 45 lines (Mesh)

**Reduction**: 82 lines, 100% mesh-based ‚úÖ

## Architecture Notes

### Why This Cleanup Was Needed

1. **AI-generated dead code**: Claude Code created comprehensive selection rendering with 3 functions, but only 1 was ever registered as a system
2. **Architecture violation**: Used Gizmos despite CLAUDE.md forbidding them
3. **Duplicate functionality**: Point rendering was already working correctly in `points.rs`

### Why The Original System Worked

The user's original point selection rendering in `points.rs` was already mesh-based and working correctly:

```rust
let (outline_color, middle_color) = if selected.is_some() {
    (
        theme.theme().selected_secondary_color(),
        theme.theme().selected_primary_color(),
    )
} else {
    // normal colors...
}
```

This was perfect and didn't need changing. The AI just added redundant Gizmo-based rendering that wasn't needed or used.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Phase 1 & 2 Complete** - All Gizmos removed
2. üîÑ **User Testing** - Test selection marquee rendering
3. ‚è≥ **Remaining Cleanup** - Explicit plugin registration, stub tools
